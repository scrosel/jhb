		<h3>GEMS</h3>
		<p> - are an extraterestrial species of "magical", roughly humanoid beings that play a keyrole in the Steven Universe franchise.</p>
		<br>
		<p> They are made of light, their humanoid appearances are projections from their gemstones, which can be changed anytime. "holograms with mass".</p>
		<p> The only features that stay are the gem, and their color scheme.</p>
		<br>
		<p> Only the gemstones can be permanently damaged or killed.</p>
		<br>
		<p> There are a variety of gemstones which decides a gems's basic abilities, general appearances, skills, personality and their name.
		There are multpiple gems with the same gemstone except for the Diamonds. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Gems have inhuman abilities, like shape-shifting, enhanced physical strength, weapon-summoning, fusion, the power to store material in a pocket dimension 
		within their gemstone, the ability to use their gemstone as a flashlight, and bubble creation.

		<h3>THE DIAMONDS</h3>
		<p>The Great Diamond Authority was the matriarchal body of Gem leaders. Its membership consisted of White Diamond,
		Yellow Diamond, Blue Diamond, and, prior to Era 2, Pink Diamond.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Before they changed their ways, the Great Diamond Authority had complete control over every Gem and their race's endeavors. 
		As confirmed in Steven Universe: End of an Era, each Diamond was responsible for overseeing a specific part of Homeworld society.
		White was the leader and in charge of establishing Gemkind's identity. Yellow and Blue, holding second-tier status, 
		oversaw Homeworld's military and culture respectively. Pink was in charge of throwing celebrations for the achievements of the other Diamonds.</p>
		<br>
		<p>it is mandatory for Gems to show absolute respect and loyalty to any Diamond they interacted with regardless of whether or not they served them. 
		Appropriate behaviors include addressing a Diamond (most commonly the one they belong to) as "My Diamond", 
		saluting them by forming a diamond shape over their chest with their hands and optionally giving them many gracious titles, 
		often to the point of bootlicking and excessive flattery before speaking with them.</p>
