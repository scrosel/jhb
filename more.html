			<h1>CRYSTAL GEMS BACKTSTORY</h1>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>The Homeworld Heirarchy</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Each Diamond was endowed with certain characteristics, ones that showed through in their underling gems.
			Yellow Diamond is militaristic and logical. She leads the colonizing armies and her associated Gems are engineers and warriors. 
			Blue Diamond is an empath whose gems tend to be prescient and emotional. Pink Diamond is passionate and her underlying gems tend to be quick to anger and joy.
			White Diamond is a fascistic leader obsessed with ideological purity. Her Gems tend to be rule followers.</p>
			<p>In Gem society, birth determines function. A Gem's type will tell others what they do with their life. 
			For example, Pearls are servants and Rubies are warriors. This will become important when an eventual rebel leader decides 
			it's time for each living Gem to decide their own destiny.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>An Off-World Colony</h3>
			<p>Pink Diamond was not typically involved in Homeworld's colonial ambitions. Her role among the leaders of Homeworld reflected her personality.
			She was largely in charge of throwing parties and other celebrations, although that all changed when she begged her fellow Diamonds to allow her her own colony.
			They relented and assigned her to Earth, where she went about making new Gems in the traditional style.
			She set up kindergartens with the knowledge that they would use up the planet.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>Growing Fascination</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Pink Diamond's empathetic tendencies eventually overwhelm her when she takes a closer look at Earth. 
			She realizes that the planet is teeming with living things and begins to question the idea of destroying the planet in service of her own people.</p>
			<p>She takes a particular interest in the lives of human beings, and their ability to be whatever they please with no regards to the circumstances of their birth. 
			Compared to the rigidity of Gem life, humanity's ability to follow their passions is downright blasphemous. 
			Still, Pink sees the good in it and tries, unsuccessfully, to convince her fellow diamonds to call off the colony.</p>
			<p>The Diamonds refuse, and urge Pink Diamond to carry out the job of using up and abandoning the planet, thereby destroying all of humanity and other life on Earth.
			The problem of destroying Earth weighs on Pink Diamond so heavily that she begins to think in ways that are entirely antithetical to Gems' 
			rigid society and sense of duty. In short, this leader of the Gem home world finds her thoughts turning toward rebellion.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>A Clever Plan</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Pink Diamond decides to rebel against the Gem Homeworld in order to save life on Earth. 
			While the story of how this happens is meted out slowly over the course of the series, it's relatively straightforward once it becomes clear.</p>
			<p>Pink Diamond, knowing she's too much of a target to remain in her Diamond form and also be a rebel leader, 
			fakes her own death with the help of her lieutenant Pearl, assuming the form of a rebellious gem named Rose Quartz after being "assassinated" on Earth. 
			At the same time, Pearl begins to train as a knight, learning sword skills to fight the coming retaliation from Homeworld.</p>
			<p>They found the Crystal Gems and declare themselves in open rebellion against Homeworld, 
			at which point they began to enlist recruits among disenchanted gems who chafed against the strict nature of Gem society.
			The coming war between the ragtag band of guerrilla gems and the Homeworld empire will last thousands of years and end in a nearly unspeakable tragedy.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>Homeworld Strikes Back</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Blue Diamond invades Earth to take it back from the upstart rebel leader Rose Quartz, fully unaware that Rose is Pink Diamond. 
			In one of the ensuing battles between Rose's band of Crystal Gems and Blue Diamond's shock troops, a fateful accident earns the Gems a new and valuable general.</p>
			<p>While attempting to save her secret paramour from an attack by Pearl, a Ruby accidentally merges with a Sapphire creating the fusion known as Garnet. 
			Combined, she has Sapphire's ability to see the future and Ruby's incredible fighting prowess. 
			Still, rather than seeing this as a useful asset, Blue Diamond reacts with revulsion to their fusion. 
			She orders that Ruby be "shattered" for fusing with a gem of higher status, in effect laying out a death sentence. 
			Rather than submit to the sentence, Sapphire and Ruby join the rebellion on Earth, 
			living in fusion as Garnet, and quickly become one of the Crystal Gems' most valuable fighters.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>An Unspeakable Weapon</h3>
			<br>
			<p>To end the war, Homeworld essentially nukes the planet. They opt to hit the Earth with a planet-wide blast from a weapon called the Corrupting Light.
			Any Gem on the Earth's surface caught in the blast would have their Gem, their very essence, permanently corrupted.
			While Gems have the ability to retreat within and regenerate in the event that they are grievously injured, the Light ensured that they could never recover. 
			If the affected Gems attempted to regenerate, they would regain form as hideous and unintelligible monsters that are seemingly incapable of rational thought. 
			The surviving Gems found themselves surrounded by their friends — who they had fought alongside for centuries — irreversibly morphed into terrifying beasts.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>A Sort of Peace</h3>
			<br>
			<p>The war dies down after this blast, as the Homeworld Gems believe the Earth is now useless as a colony. 
			Thinking that the rebellion had largely been quashed and their outpost to create Gems was ruined by the use of the Corrupting Light, 
			they retreat to Homeworld and leave the Crystal Gems to pick up the pieces.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>Meeting Amethyst</h3>
			<p>Not all gems being formed in Earth's "kindergarten" were ruined by the blast, as the Crystal Gems soon found out. 
			They meet a runty Amethyst gem, who was protected from the Corrupting Light by a rock outcropping where she was being formed. 
			She comes to join the Crystal Gems as they try to help Earth recover. While she is frequently viewed as an adult by Steven, 
			the viewer's lens into the world of Gems throughout the show, she frequently struggles with the fact that she was not an original member of the rebel 
			group and has no memories of the long war.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>Falling In Love</h3>
			<br>
			<p>While the Gems continue to live on Earth, Rose's fascination with humans grows. She falls in love with a human, 
			a rock musician who performs under the name Greg Universe. They decide to have a child and through a method that's never really explained, 
			they create the show's titular character: a half-human, half-gem named Steven Universe. The creation process is the end of Rose Quartz, 
			who subsumes herself into Steven's Gem. This gives the young Steven the powers of his mother, but none of her memories. 
			Much of the series deals with Steven sussing out the history of his mother, who is also him. Other Gems still view him as his mother, 
			and he has to teach them that he's someone entirely distinct while coming to grips with what his past self did.</p>
